### Overview

The Paxtogeddon reader is source code to create a weaponised reader to target Paxton Net2 and Switch2 tokens.

Features:

* CLK/DATA decoding straight off the back of the reader
* Paxton auth token decoding
  * Also determines if its was a Net2 or Switch2 token, and even the colour of the fob!
* Persistent log saving on SPIFFS
* Wifi AP ect for in the field shinanigans

### Quote from the codes main developer

```
"Anyone can share it mate, do whatever you want with it. 
Stick it on your own GitHub, I don‚Äôt mind at all. üëç"
```

Note I was not the main writer of this code, but Dan couldn't be bothered to put it on GitHub because he not a hacker.

### Quote from En4rab

```
‚ÄúI would have used my own code but it was shit and Daniel's is much better‚Äù
```
