The original case design was by 00Waz and this version was edited by en4rab to 
fit an Anker powerbank and pcb reader, any problems with it are en4rab's fault.
To make a reader you need "Paxtogeddon reader bracket.stl" and "Paxtogeddon reader case anker.stl"

If you don’t have a P200 reader but want to make a demo device with a different 
model of reader there is "Paxtogeddon reader case coverplate.stl" which will 
adapt a P75 or P50 reader to fit on the case.
